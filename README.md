Demo at [REPL](https://svelte.dev/repl/2a73898419014e96a607d070635445df?version=3.55.1)

No dependencies.  

This is two component in one package.  

1. A HSV colour picker supporting HSV and alpha.  

2. A Palette picker for preset colours. These colours can be edited by the end user using the HSV colour picker above.  

dispatches 'input' and 'change' messages -  REPL for example.
